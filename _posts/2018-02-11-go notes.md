# CSP

“Another lineage among Go’s ancestors, and one that makes Go distinctive among recent programming languages,
is a sequence of little-known research languages developed at Bell Labs, all inspired by the concept of
communicating sequential processes (CSP) from Tony Hoare’s seminal 1978 paper on the foundations of concurrency. In CSP, a program is a parallel composition of processes that have no shared state; the processes communicate and synchronize using channels.”

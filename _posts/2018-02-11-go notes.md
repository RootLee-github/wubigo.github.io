# CSP

“Another lineage among Go’s ancestors, and one that makes Go distinctive among recent programming languages,
is a sequence of little-known research languages developed at Bell Labs, all inspired by the concept of
communicating sequential processes (CSP) from Tony Hoare’s seminal 1978 paper on the foundations of concurrency. In CSP, a program is a parallel composition of processes that have no shared state; the processes communicate and synchronize using channels.”

# hindsight
“As a recent high-level language, Go has the benefit of hindsight, and the basics are done well: it has garbage collection, a package system, first-class functions, lexical scope, a system call interface, and immutable strings in which text is generally encoded in UTF-8. But it has comparatively few features and is unlikely to add more. For instance, it has no implicit numeric conversions, no constructors or destructors, no operator overloading, no default parameter values, no inheritance, no generics, no exceptions, no macros, no function annotations, and no thread-local storage”

# gofmt
Go does not require semicolons at the ends of statements or declarations, except where two or more appear on the same line. In effect, newlines following certain tokens are converted into semicolons, so where newlines are placed matters to proper parsing of Go code. For instance, the opening brace { of the function must be on the same line as the end of the func declaration, not on a line by itself, and in the expression x + y, a newline is permitted after but not before the + operator.

# point var
* “The variable to which p points is written *p. The expression *p yields the value of that variable, an int, but since *p denotes a variable, it may also appear on the left-hand side of an assignment, in which case the assignment updates the variable.”
* “Expressions that denote variables are the only expressions to which the address-of operator & may be applied.”
* “Each time we take the address of a variable or copy a pointer, we create new aliases or ways to identify the same variable. For example, *p is an alias for v.”

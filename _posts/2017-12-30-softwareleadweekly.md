# Three Powerful Conversations Managers Must Have To Develop Their People

1. Starting with kindergarten, tell me about your life

2. Spot their lighthouse and bring it into focus  “The idea is to try to get employees to start to talk to you about their dreams, or three to five of them if they don't really want to commit to one idea. None of it should be time-bound — no 10-year plans. Ask what this person would be doing at the pinnacle of his or her career — when they’re feeling challenged, engaged and not wanting anything else.”

3. Create a career action plan

## set registry

```
npm config set registry=http://registry.npm.taobao.org

npm config ls -l

userconfig = "C:\\Users\\Administrator\\.npmrc"
```


## declare variables

ES6 comes with two more options to declare your variables: const and let. In JavaScript ES6, you will

rarely find var anymore.

A variable declared with const cannot be re-assigned or re-declared. It cannot get mutated (changed,

modified)

Immutability is embraced in React and its ecosystem. That’s why const should be your default

choice when you define a variable.


## ES6 Arrow Functions


```
// function expression
function () { ... }
// arrow function expression
() => { ... }
```


You can remove the   parentheses when the function

gets only one argument, but have to keep them when 

it gets multiple arguments.


```
// allowed
item => { ... }
// allowed
(item) => { ... }


// not allowed
item, key => { ... }
// allowed
(item, key) => { ... }

```



Additionally, you can remove the block body, meaning the curly braces, of the ES6 arrow function.
In a concise body an implicit return is attached. Thus you can remove the return statement. That
will happen more often in the book, so be sure to understand the difference between a block body
and a concise body when using arrow functions


##  ES6 Object Initializer

you are allowed to use computed property names in JavaScript ES6

```
// ES6
const key = 'name';
const user = {
  \[key]: 'Robin',
};
```

## Bindings

class methods don’t

automatically bind this to the class instance

That’s a main source of bugs when using React, because if you want to access

this.state in your class method, it cannot be retrieved because this is undefined. So in order to

make this accessible in your class methods, you have to bind the class methods to this.

class methods can be autobound automatically without

binding them explicitly by using JavaScript ES6 arrow functions

```
class A { 
    constructor() {
        this.foo = this.foo.bind(this)
    }

    foo() {
        console.log('foo from A')
    }
}





class A {
    foo = () => {
        console.log('foo from A')
    }
}
```


The official React documentation sticks to the class method bindings in the constructor

# PersistentVolume

A PersistentVolume (PV) is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been manually provisioned by an administrator, or dynamically provisioned by Kubernetes using a StorageClass. Many cluster environments have a default StorageClass installed. When a StorageClass is not specified in the PersistentVolumeClaim, the clusterâ€™s default StorageClass is used instead

In local clusters, the default StorageClass uses the hostPath provisioner. hostPath volumes are only suitable for development and testing. With hostPath volumes, the data lives in /tmp on the node the Pod is scheduled onto and does not move between nodes
